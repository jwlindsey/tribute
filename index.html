            The man who inspired his and future generations. No one asks what can Elon Musk do, they ask what can't Elon Musk do? He is perhaps the most inspiring South African born American Canadian of our generation.

          <p class="text-justify">
            As CEO of SpaceX, CEO of Tesla, and cofounder of OpenAI, Musk seems to be everywhere all at once, pushing all kinds of incredible new technologies. He's said he won't be happy until we've escaped Earth and colonized Mars.
          </p>
          <p class="text-justify">
            He also bought another company via Tesla which was founded by Musk, a solar-panel manufacturer SolarCity, because not only does he want to give explorers something to dream about but he also wants to clean our planet up with clean, renewable energy.
          </p>
          <p class="text-justify">
            Between space rockets, electric cars, solar batteries, research into killer robots, and the billions he's made and lost along the way, Musk is basically a real life Tony Stark. Which is why they used him as reference for the "Iron Man."
